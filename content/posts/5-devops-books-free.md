Whether you are new to the movement, or you are a DevOps veteran, here is a great reading list that will help you to develop your skills. Moreover, all of the listed books are available absolutely **FREE OF CHARGE**!

## 1. Designing Distributed Systems

> Without established design patterns to guide them, developers have had to build distributed systems from scratch, and most of these systems are very unique indeed. Today, the increasing use of containers has paved the way for core distributed system patterns and reusable containerized components. This practical guide presents a collection of repeatable, generic patterns to help make the development of reliable distributed systems far more approachable and efficient.

The book is available [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/designing-distributed-systems/) for free of charge.

> Legend has it that Google deploys over two billion application containers a week. How’s that possible? Google revealed the secret through a project called Kubernetes, an open source cluster orchestrator (based on its internal Borg system) that radically simplifies the task of building, deploying, and maintaining scalable distributed systems in the cloud. This practical guide shows you how Kubernetes and container technology can help you achieve new levels of velocity, agility, reliability, and efficiency.
