        <p class="lead my-3">My name is Artem. I am a software developer, and occasional writer.</p>
        <p class="lead my-3">You are looking at my <a href="https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden">digital garden</a>. I stole the term from Joel Hooks. Hopefully, he doesn't mind.</p>
        <p class="lead my-3">Since it is a garden, there is no strict organization. The posts might share very little in common, or express a complete thought. That said, they are mostly related to programming and software development. Stuff that I do on day to day basis.</p>
        <p class="lead my-3"><a href="{{ .Site.BaseURL }}posts/">The following page let you view all of my blog posts</a> in the chronological order. However, I also have a section below with my personal favorites.</p>
        <p class="lead my-3"><a href="{{ .Site.BaseURL }}projects/">Same goes for my projects. You can find them all here</a>, but the featured ones are right below on this page.</p>
        <p class="lead my-3">Most of the smaller code snippets you see in my posts can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/aakatev">GitHub</a>.</p>
        <p class="lead my-3">If you'd like to get in touch with me <a href="mailto:akatevone@gmail.com">email</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/artem-akatev-b68195144/">linkedin</a> are your best channels.</p>
        <p class="lead my-3">All of my articles are also available on <a href="https://dev.to/aakatev">dev.to</a>.</p>
