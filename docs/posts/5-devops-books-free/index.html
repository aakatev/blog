<h2 id="1-designing-distributed-systems">1. Designing Distributed Systems</h2>
<p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/812zzcz1z6ftlmjpx806.png" alt="Alt Text"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Without established design patterns to guide them, developers have had to build distributed systems from scratch, and most of these systems are very unique indeed. Today, the increasing use of containers has paved the way for core distributed system patterns and reusable containerized components. This practical guide presents a collection of repeatable, generic patterns to help make the development of reliable distributed systems far more approachable and efficient.</p>

<p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/axrfc1us35ri0cmoa8my.jpg" alt="Alt Text"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can a system be considered truly reliable if it isn&rsquo;t fundamentally secure? Or can it be considered secure if it&rsquo;s unreliable? Security is crucial to the design and operation of scalable systems in production, as it plays an important part in product quality, performance, and availability.</p>

<h2 id="5-kubernetes-up-and-running">5. Kubernetes: Up and Running</h2>
<p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/m5lfficgkkrovs3y7ro5.jpg" alt="Alt Text"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Legend has it that Google deploys over two billion application containers a week. How’s that possible? Google revealed the secret through a project called Kubernetes, an open source cluster orchestrator (based on its internal Borg system) that radically simplifies the task of building, deploying, and maintaining scalable distributed systems in the cloud. This practical guide shows you how Kubernetes and container technology can help you achieve new levels of velocity, agility, reliability, and efficiency.</p>
